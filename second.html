                   <p> Welcome to our website. I know what you're thinking, and no, this is not a cult. We are simply students who are adamant about the removal of the block schedule here at Citrus Valley High School due to the inconveniences it places upon the student's academic development and the staff's ability to teach effectively. We hope to convince both you and the school board of reestablishing the block schedule for the future years to come.</p>
                   
                  <p><b>"Why is block so special," you ask?</b> Blocking schedule is crucial to the betterment of our student's academic prowess because it allows the student time to confide in their teacher about their problems with homework, allows them to better manage their time, and rewards them with a much needed break when they have finished their work. However, now that block is gone, students stay up innumerous hours in order to finish the enormus pile of homework that is due the next day. This in turn hinders thier ability to focus and stunts their academic progress.</p>
